This directory contains a set of predefined serialized
strings that are tested

  a) against the Parser
  b) against the Dumpers (Text, XML, ...)

Dumpers have their own subdirectory.

Each directory contains the expected data and each tests'
last result is stored next to it as well.

The parser expects text in the form of  print_r() of the
array notation but with whitespace at the end of each line
removed (rtrim'med print_r).

The dumpers expect text/binary data in the form of the
dumper (e.g. XML for the XML dumper).

To add more test data, add an entry into the array in
testData.php and one expected-file for parser and all
dumpers in the according directories.

Related test classes are:

 - tests/Serialized/ParserDataTest.php
 - tests/Serialized/DumperTest.php

If you plan to provide test data ensure it does not
contain any private information.

Alternatively you can make use of the old style data-tests
working from:

 - tests/DataTest.php

until inclusion of additional testData.php files is available
(which will mark the end from the old style data-tests).
