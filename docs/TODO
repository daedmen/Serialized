 [x] Tests for Serialized::loadLibrary() - all classes covered?
 [/] Dumper: Factory / additional Dumpers (Dumper_Text, Dumper_VarDump etc.)
 [ ] Dumper: Prepare merge with DumperXML
 [ ] Dumper: solve typeByName() code duplication (taken from Parser) 
 [?] Add Static Serialized::parse()
 [?] Add Static Serialized::dump()
 [ ] Validate class- and member-mame parsing


 (?) It should be helpful to have a token stream with byte offsets and
     to not rely on strucutre and data only as this is with the current
     parser. Additionally this is helpful if confronted with broken se-
     rialized data (and yes, we hate to run over that in practice).
 (?) Value Interface: add public function setParsed(array $parsed); (clash-
     es Parser)
 (?) Any chance to see RECURSION INDECIES numerically validated?
 	- numeric index en parallel to parsing referencing array notations
 	- own recursion validator/resolver class
