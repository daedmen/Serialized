 [x] Move Dumper into class of it's own.
 [x] Dumper: Do Nice-Printing ASCII 7bit safe
 [x] Tests for Serialized::loadLibrary() - all classes covered?
 [x] Dumper: Factory / additional Dumpers (Dumper_Text, Dumper_VarDump etc.)
     [x] Prepare merge with DumperXML
     [x] Generalized option handling for dumpers (option/config array)
     [x] Dumper Interface
 [x] Arrange examples in directories.
 [x] XML Dumper finalisation
     [x] XML correct string value=""/encoding
     [x] XML: "public" als default accessor (access="pulic") so to spare the output (StdClass Scenario)
     [x] XML: CDATA Encode attribute values of Array-Keys, Object-Member and Class-Names.
     [x] XML: <?xml version="1.0" encoding="us-ascii" ?> per default
 [/] Dump into buffer.
 [ ] Add XSLT example.
 [ ] Validate class- and member-mame parsing.
 [ ] Create a validator for array notation data.
     [ ] When done, remove deep-redundant code from dumpers.
 [ ] Parse session data / var / var types in array notation.
 [ ] Dumper: solve typeByName() code duplication (taken from Parser).
 [ ] Add Static Serialized::parse() / Serialized::dump().


 (?) It should be helpful to have a token stream with byte offsets and
     to not rely on structure and data only as it is with the current
     parser. Additionally this is helpful if confronted with broken se-
     rialized data (and yes, we hate to run over that in practice).
 (?) Value Interface: add public function setParsed(array $parsed); (clash-
     es Parser)
 (?) Any chance to see RECURSION INDECIES numerically validated?
 	- numeric index en parallel to parsing referencing array notations
 	- own recursion validator/resolver class
