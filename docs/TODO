 [.] Add XSLT example.
 [x] Dump into buffer.

 [x] Parse session data / var / var types in array notation.
 [ ] Update Array Notation ODT/PDF for sessions
 [ ] Add support for Serializable interface (C serialize type)
 	[ ] Create a testsuite that works on example data for both
 	    parsing and dumping more easily.

 [ ] Add Offset when throwing a parse error / Add offset to ParseException
 [ ] Add DumpException (probably).

 [ ] Find a better place for serialized.xml/dtd (examples dir currently)
 [ ] Validate class- and member-mame parsing.
 [ ] Create a validator for array notation data.
     [ ] When done, remove deep-redundant code from dumpers.
 [ ] Add Static Serialized::parse() / Serialized::dump().


 (?) It should be helpful to have a token stream with byte offsets and
     to not rely on structure and data only as it is with the current
     parser. Additionally this is helpful if confronted with broken se-
     rialized data (and yes, we hate to run over that in practice).
 (?) Value Interface: add public function setParsed(array $parsed); (clash-
     es Parser)
 (?) Any chance to see RECURSION INDECIES numerically validated?
 	- numeric index en parallel to parsing referencing array notations
 	- own recursion validator/resolver class
