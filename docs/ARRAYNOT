  INTRODUCTION

    The Array Notation represents _all_ content of a serialized string in 
  form of a standard PHP array with two values:
  
    NATIVE  ~= array(TYPE, DATA)
  
    Of which the two elements are numerically indexed:
  
      First Element  (0): TYPE (always string)
      Second Element (1): DATA (of mixed type: NULL, scalar or array)
    
    All possible forms in PHP pseudo code are therefore:
    
            array((string) TYPE, NULL);
      -or-  array((string) TYPE, (int) DATA);
      -or-  array((string) TYPE, (float) DATA);
      -or-  array((string) TYPE, (string) DATA);
      -or-  array((string) TYPE, (bool) DATA);
      -or-  array((string) TYPE, (array) DATA);
      
    The Array Notation has been chosen to represent parsed data in form
  of a parse-tree. Next to the Array Notation, a object based represenation
  is planned. See ROADMAP.
  
    DATA varies based on TYPE which can be grouped in SINGLE, COMPOUND and
  RECURSION. See the tree for grouping and association to PHP datatypes. 

                             TYPE
                              |
      SINGLE---------------COMPOUND--------------RECURSION
        |                     |                      |
        +- null               +- array               +- recursion[*]
        +- int                `- object              `- reference[*]
        +- float
        +- string
        `- bool

    The Array Notation is quite complex to explain in written form. See
  ARRAYNOT.pdf or ARRAYNOT.odg for a graphical representation.
  
  ----
    [*] recursion and reference in the tree do not represent a native PHP 
        datatype but a serialized one. They are (un)serialisation-ordered
        sequence-based non-negative integer indices starting at one.
    
  1 SINGLE DATATYPES
    
    Single datatypes are NULL and scalars (Resources can not be seria-
  lized[*]) have their value stored natively as the following table shows:
  
      # | NATIVE         | TYPE     | DATA 
    ----+----------------+----------+--------------
      1 | (null) NULL    | 'null'   | (null) NULL
      2 | (bool) TRUE    | 'bool'   | (bool) TRUE
      3 | (int) 1        | 'int'    | (int) 1 
      4 | (float) 22.5   | 'float'  | (float) 22.5  
      5 | (string) 'foo' | 'string' | (string) 'foo'
      
    TABLE: Single or simple PHP datatypes as Array Notation as
           NATIVE ~= array(TYPE, DATA) 

      As the table shows, the value of these five simple datatypes are 
    preserved in their Array Notation. The first array element names 
    the type of the stored value. 
    
      EXAMPLES:
      
      (null) NULL  ~= array('null',  (null)  NULL)
      (float) 22.5 ~= array('float', (float) 22.5)

    [*] See note on http://php.net/manual/en/function.serialize.php
  
  2 COMPOUND DATATYPES
  
    Compound datatypes are such which are complex and consist of one or
  more simple or compound datatype.
  
    In PHP those are Array and Object. Their Array 
  Notation is done by using array(TYPE, DATA) as well, but the 
  DATA part will always be an array which has a representation 
  on it's own. See the following table for a comparison with  
  simple datatypes so far:
     
      # | NATIVE   | TYPE     | DATA  
    ----+-------- -+----------+---------------------
      6 | (array)  | 'array'  | (array) array(...) 
      7 | (object) | 'object' | (array) array(...)
  
    TABLE: Compound PHP Datatypes as Array Notation (first level),
           see below for notation of values.
           
    The notation of DATA varies based on the datatype which varies 
  between array and object. See II-2-1 for array and II-2-2 for 
  object.
    
  2-1 ARRAY
  
    array('array', array(...) /* DATA */ )
   
    DATA is an array. It consists of one array with two entries per 
  each native array-entry in form of a key and value pair:
  
    NATIVE  ~= array(TYPE, DATA)
    
    ARRAY   ~= array('array', DATA)
    DATA    ~= array(array(KEY, VALUE)*)
    KEY     ~= (array-notation) [null|string|int]NATIVE
    VALUE   ~= (array-notation) [*any*]NATIVE
    
    Key elements are represented in their simple datatype Array Notation
  as explained above. Key in PHP arrays can only be NULL, integer or 
  string[*]. Values are represented in their Array Notation based on 
  their datatype: SIMPLE, COMPOUND or REFERENCE. 
  
    EXAMPLE: Array with string datatypes (simple) in Array Notation
    
      Native:
    
      array( 
          (string) 'key' => (string) 'value'
       )
      
      Array Notation:
      
      array(
         (string) 'array',  array(
		     array(
                 array((string) 'string', (string) 'key'),  # key   \_ pair
                 array((string) 'string', (string) 'value') # value /
			 )
         )
      )
      
    As the example shows, DATA is an array of one key/value pair of their
  values own Array Notation.
  
    HINT: The library can print out array notations as preformatted and 
          better readable text for debugging purposes. 
  
  2-2 OBJECT
  
    array('object', array(...) /* DATA */ )  
   
    DATA is an array. It contains two entries per object of which the 
  first one is representing the class-name and the second entry represents 
  the class-members.
  
    In difference to the notation of arrays, and additional third level is 
  added. Basically this is the blueprint:
      
      NATIVE  ~= array(TYPE, DATA)
      
      OBJECT  ~= array('object', DATA)  
      DATA    ~= array(NAME, MEMBERS)  // compare: array(TYPE, DATA)
      NAME    ~= array('classname', (string))
      MEMBERS ~= array(array(MEMBER, VALUE)*)
      MEMBER  ~= array('member', (string))
      VALUE   ~= (array-notation) [*any*]NATIVE
  
    Class-members is an array of one key/value pair of members and their 
  values in their own Array Notation comparable to arrays with their keys 
  and values.
  
    EXAMPLE: Object with string member (simple) in Array Notation
    
      Native (as pseudo-code):
  
      $foo = new stdClass;
      $foo->membername = 'bar';
    
      Array Notation:
    
      array(
          (string) 'object', 
          array(
              array((string) 'classname', (string) 'stdClass'),
              array((string) 'members', (array) array(
                  array(
                      array('member', (str) 'membername'), # member \_ pair
                      array('string', (str) 'bar')         # value  /
                  )
              )
          )
      )
    
    As the example shows, DATA is an array with two entries representing 
  classname and members.
     
    Members is an array of member/value pairs while member names are 
  type-hinted as 'member' following with the string of their name and
  values are written in their own Array Notation. Values can be of any
  type available.
  
  3 RECURSION
  
    FIXME: This needs to be documented
    
		self::TYPE_INVALID => 'invalid',
		
		self::TYPE_RECURSION => 'r',


## Misc Notes
The lowercase "r" will be a recursion, 
while the uppercase "R" will be a recursion by reference.

// serialized recursion - the ABC
$o = new stdClass;

// recursion
$o->normal = $o;

// recursion by reference
$o->reference = &$o;

echo serialize($o);
// O:8:"stdClass":2:{s:6:"normal";r:1;s:9:"reference";R:1;}

We should focus into r:1; and R:1;.

While the "r", or the "R", means there is a recursion, the unsigned 
integer indicates the exact object that "caused" that recursion.
When we perform an unserialize operation, the parser cannot obviously 
de-serialize as we read, because if we have an instance or an array, 
internal values should be ready to be assigned already 
"unserialized".
This simply means that the number after the R is not sequential, and 
there is no relation with the length of the string, but only a 
relation with de-serialization process.
